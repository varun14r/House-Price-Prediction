# House-Price-Prediction

## Overview

The House Price Prediction project is a machine learning project designed to predict house prices based on a variety of features. It leverages a dataset containing information about houses, including attributes like average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population. This project showcases data analysis, visualization, data preparation, model training, and evaluation using linear regression.
